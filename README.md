# Inventory-OOP
Inventory application made to demonstrate OOP principles during HyperionDev bootcamp.
The application currently only operates on one class (Shoes) but can be expanded to manipulate other types of data / stock.
The application includes several functions which might be useful when maintaining a database of stock.
Currently the application does not have a GUI and runs in the terminal only, though its output is saved to a separate txt file.
